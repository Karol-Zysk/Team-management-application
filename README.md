Team management application

An application was developed for a client whose team utilizes clockify.me to manage their working hours. Thanks to the integration with the Clockify API, the application offers functionalities that are typically available only for premium accounts on the clockify.me platform.

To get started, the clockify_api_key needs to be entered into the application, allowing for automatic synchronization of our database with clockify, including employee information. With employee hourly rates added, the application enables the generation of earnings reports for any period of time, as well as project reports with possible cost and time estimates. Once the reports are generated, a comparison is made between the estimated and actual costs and time spent.

In summary, the integration with the Clockify API brings enhanced functionality to our application, simplifying the process of managing employee hours and generating comprehensive reports.
